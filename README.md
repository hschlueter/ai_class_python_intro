Python Intro for the AI Class
=============================

This little tutorial should enable you to complete the exercises from the AI
class, i.e., you should be able to use python to implement your solution,
execute the unittests/doctests, and use git to get new exercises and publish
your solutions.

[non-interactive version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hschlueter/ai_class_python_intro/blob/master/ai_getting_started.ipynb)

Or use the interactive ipython notebook version:
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
if you want to run this with slides you need the Slide-Mode NB-Extension: [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE)
```
$ conda install -c damianavila82 rise
```

If you have problems with python, the ipython notebook, and dependencies please
use anoconda. Download it from: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
